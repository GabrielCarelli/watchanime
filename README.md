# 🧠 AnimeHub

Welcome to **AnimeHub** — a sleek and minimal anime explorer built with cutting-edge tools like **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the elegant **shadcn/ui** component library. Whether you're a fellow otaku or just curious about how to deploy on **Vercel**, this project was born from a personal learning journey into smooth deployment workflows.

## 🎯 About This Project

I built this app in just a few minutes—mainly to overcome some past headaches I had with Vercel deployments. But what started as a simple experiment quickly turned into a slick little anime browser using the awesome [Shikimori API](https://shikimori.one/api/doc).

> Think of it as a playground turned potential project. The goal was to **study deployment**, but there's definitely room to grow!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React framework for server-side rendering and fast navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** – Beautiful and accessible UI components
- **Shikimori API** – Rich anime data straight from the source

## 🧪 Getting Started

Wanna try it locally? Here's how:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/GabrielCarelli/otakuhub.git
cd otakuhub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start exploring!

## 🌱 What's Next?

Although OtakuHub started as a deployment study, there's potential to grow it into a full-fledged anime dashboard. Some future ideas:

- 🔍 Anime search and filtering
- ❤️ Favorites and watchlists
- 🧭 User accounts and preferences
- 📱 Responsive enhancements
